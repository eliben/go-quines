# go-quines

Some quines in the Go programming language

* `quine-str-regular.go`: A quine I came up with after reading some Python code
  that does something similar. It's very simple, without using any special
  ASCII codes for quotes, but it does require a lot of the code on one long
  line.
* `quine-str-rsc.go`: A quine crafted by Russ Cox and show in a
  [2010 blog post](https://research.swtch.com/zip). This one is using the
  Go backtick quote for nicer code formatting.
